## Windows PowerShell modules with PowerShell Core 6.1

Starting with [Windows 10 Insiders Build 17711](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/07/06/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-17711/), changes have been made to inbox Windows PowerShell modules to add compatibility with PowerShell Core 6.
With the [Preview.4 release of PowerShell Core 6.1](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/tag/v6.1.0-preview.4) you can use some Windows PowerShell modules without additional work.

```powershell
Get-Module -ListAvailable

# shows modules from:
#   - $env:UserProfile\Documents\PowerShell\Modules
#   - $env:ProgramFiles\PowerShell\Modules
#   - $env:WinDir\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules
```

Specifically, modules that have some level of validation will have the `CompatiblePSEditions` property in its module manifest include `Core` which enables it to show up automatically.
Over time, we expect many more inbox Windows PowerShell modules to be converted to be compatible and have their `CompatiblePSEditions` property updated.
